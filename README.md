# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Install Docker

* Open docker preferences -> File sharing tab & add the rails project path. This is to enable the changes in the host to be reflected in the docker machine.

* docker-compose build

* docker-compose up

* `docker ps` will list the created containers.

If any task fails, 

`docker exec -it machine_name bash`

To get inside the machine. And run the task

* Hit www.mywebsite.org in browser to use the app.

* Sign up a user and then use it to sign in.
