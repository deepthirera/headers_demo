<p>Both Firefox and Chrome have a feature for creating temporary private
browsing sessions. Firefox calls it <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history">Private Browsing</a><sup class="print-only cite">1</sup> and Chrome
calls it <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464">Incognito Mode</a><sup class="print-only cite">2</sup>. Both work essentially the same way. A
temporary browsing session is started without carrying over most
existing session state (cookies, etc.), and no state (cookies,
browsing history, cached data, etc.) is preserved after ending the
session. Depending on the configuration, some browser extensions will
be enabled in the private session, and their own internal state may be
preserved.</p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/shH5ALdqmZysSU2F5SF52674W7NFP1xtLBZMuzUR5u6Uotbgql3ATFFFhtkJjBCm4R3i=s180" />
